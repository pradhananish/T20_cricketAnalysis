## 📌 Analysis Plan

### 1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handle missing or inconsistent values
- Normalize data types
- Create derived metrics (e.g., batting/bowling averages, strike rates)

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyze player and team performance
- Identify top performers: runs, wickets, economy rate
- Investigate trends and match factors (e.g., toss impact)

### 3. **Statistical Modeling** *(Optional)*
- Predict match outcomes or player performance
- Possible algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest

### 4. **Visualization**
- Create compelling charts and graphs using:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Plotly
- Optional Power BI dashboard for interactive reporting
